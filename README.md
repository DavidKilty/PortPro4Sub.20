## It's Giving Tips

It's Giving Tips is a digital tipping platform that allows users to send and receive monetary tips easily and securely. This platform enables users to create unique profiles, search for other users via their unique Tip Jar ID, and send tips with just a few clicks. The platform is designed to facilitate seamless transactions between users while providing a user-friendly experience. 

Originally, I had come up with the idea to marketed at a performer like a life performance artist, typically a Drag performer who relies on tips from the audience when performing to bolster their income. The platform was designed so the tip goes straight to the performer and they have full autonomy over their own tips. I then realised that it could be used by any service individual that could share the personal ID number with another user. 

When you sign up a personal ID number is created, which can be searched for via the search bar. Much like an actual tipping pot you can see how much has been put in, and add more yourself. You need to be signed up to access this portion of the site and onnce you have located the tip jar with by searching the ID number, you add tips ranging from 20 Cents to 20 Euros.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to register an account so that I can have a personal Tip Jar ID.
- As a user, I want to log in securely so that I can access my profile and tip balance.
- As a user, I want to search for other users by their Tip Jar ID so that I can send them tips.

## Testing 

I used the manual testing methods for checking my code: 

- PEP8
- Adding and subtracting tips in the 'Tip Jar' section 
- Creating multiple test users to see that the search bar works 
- Using my local terminal in my IDE 

# Bugs found 

- I have indentation errors but no actual bugs that hinder it from functioning 

## Continuing

In the future I would incorporate the following for this project 

* Mor aesthetic design for the Tip Jar 
* A QR generator for ease of access to Tip Jar 
* Include pre approved payment methods
